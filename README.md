# ObjectDetection
Object Segmentation Project
The objective of this project was to develop a high-accuracy object detection model capable of identifying various objects, including cars, on the road. We leveraged libraries such as Detectron, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow to build and optimize the model. Additionally, we evaluated its performance by comparing training and validation loss across different models to ensure robustness and accuracy.
